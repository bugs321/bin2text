# bin2text
bin2text is a simple utility tool that allows you to convert binary files (like .exe, .zip, .tar, etc.) into text-based representations for secure or convenient storage, sharing, or transmission. It also supports reversing the processâ€”decrypting the text back into its original binary form.
